# PersonaFetch
NeoFetch, but for developers
## How it works?
PersonaFetch copies the NeoFetch system for show your informations. It makes forwarding your infos easier. You can use the output for making it a signature, design business cards and much more!
## Usage
You can run the script simply:
```bash
python3 persona_fetch.py
```
But there's options:<br><br>
`--lang [en,tr]` : You can decide the output's language; Turkish or English (Default is English)<br><br>
`--no-color` : Don't want colors? No problem! You can turn off coloring with this option<br><br>
Example:<br><br>
